title: Other people's data.
--- 

Keeping the customer's data safe and secure requires a large set of precautions. Listed below are a few of the precautions that we take here at [tidy.io](https://www.tidy.io) (the new way to Archive and Backup your files direct from Dropbox!)

When you build software that stores other people's data you take on a huge responsibility. Losing someone's data just isn't an option and neither is allowing others to gain access to it. So thatâ€™s our main, obsessively pursued, objective for tidy.io!

# HTTPS everywhere 

It goes without saying that all pages shown to logged-in users should be served over HTTPS (the secure variant of the HTTP protocol used to serve up web pages, look for the padlock in your address bar.) But that isn't quite enough, it's not much good having all the logged in pages served via HTTPS if you serve the login form over HTTP. A surprising number of sites do this and it makes the whole HTTPS thing a bit pointless, an attacker can simply send a modified version of the login form that forwards the user's details to them. HTTPS is easy to do and servers are plenty fast these days so there's really no excuse not to use it on all your pages, so that's exactly what we do!

# Encrypt all the things

If you store private user data on another service you really need to encrypt it. tidy.io uses Amazon's [Glacier](http://aws.amazon.com/glacier/) and [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) services to store your data. Both of these services encrypt the data stored on them, but that's not enough: tidy.io also encrypts the data before sending it to Glacier/S3, so while we do store you data on Amazon's servers even Amazon themselves can not look at it.

# Don't write it yourself 

Every line of code you write is a chance to screw things up, even for the very best programmers. So if there's a well tested and reliable library available then you should use that. This is extra important for encryption stuff, it's so easy to mess it up in non-obvious ways that leave it seeming to work but which gives an attacker an easy way in. This principle also applies to most other things but a few other important ones are parsing, compression, and user authentication. So don't write it yourself, use a well tested library! (and if you *do* have to write it yourself, then release the code so others can look it over)

# Sanity checks

Sanity checks are your friend. Anywhere you're making an assumption why not add an assertion that confirms it? Assertions are great as a form of documentation as well (as long as they're not the *only* form!) It's (almost) always better to fail early then it is to continue running with potentially invalid data.

# Test test test

Automated tests are vital to reliable software. From unit tests for the individual pieces all the way up to full integration tests, this is the way to find out right away if anything breaks.
  
# Integrate Continuously

Tests on their own are great, but they still leave you vulnerable to the dreaded "works on my machine" syndrome. It's also easy to forget to run the tests after a change. The fix to both of these issues is automatic CI (Continuous Integration). Every time new code is pushed to the repository the CI server checks it out and runs all the tests in a clean environment. Traditionally CI servers have been a pain in the neck to run (or maybe it's just me?) but thanks to a great new startup called [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) that isn't such an issue anymore. Do check them out!

# Early warning system

If anything *does* go wrong you want to know right away so that you can fix it before your users even notice. So set up decent logging right from the start that lets you check everything that happens in your system. And make sure it emails you the minute anything looks off!

# Conclusion

No system is perfect but by taking care testing well and not trusting any one part it's possible to make something that is pretty darn reliable and safe.

Thanks for listening!
